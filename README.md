# pygame

This repo is for pygame experiments and testing, i already made
a tetris clon that you can play B).

## Installation

I recomend the use of a virtual environment, for this run the
following command:

    python -m venv .venv

Once created the virtual environment, we need to activate it, run
this:

    source .venv/bin/activate

Then use the `pip` commande to install the package `pygame`:

    pip install pygame

## Nixos installation

In case you're using nixos, use this:

    nix-shell

## How to play tetris clon?

Run this command:

    python src/tetris.py
